In this initiative, we aim to forecast the outcomes of football matches within the English Premier League (EPL).

**Project Workflow**

* Utilize requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas to scrape match data.  
* Preprocess the data for machine learning using pandas.
* Generate predictions on match outcomes using scikit-learn.
* Evaluate the prediction accuracy and enhance our forecasting methods.
